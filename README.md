# Pokedex Game
## Overview
The Pokedex Game is a fun and interactive web app built using React. In this game, players can see how 8 randomly selected Pokémon stack up against each other based on their experience points (XP). The goal is to form two teams of 4 Pokémon each, compare their XP totals, and see which team wins! Every time the page is refreshed, the teams are reshuffled, giving players a fresh experience each time.

## Features
Props in React: The game demonstrates how to pass data using props in React, allowing different components to communicate and share information.
API Integration: Pokémon data is dynamically fetched from an external API, making the game experience data-driven and interactive.
Random Team Assignment: Every page refresh generates two new teams of 4 Pokémon, randomly selecting Pokémon from a pool and comparing their XP to determine the winner.

## How It Works
Random Pokémon Selection: The app fetches a list of Pokémon and their experience points from an external API.
Team Formation: 8 Pokémon are randomly chosen, and they are split into two teams of 4.
Experience Points Comparison: The XP totals of each team are calculated, and the team with the higher XP wins.
Refreshing for New Teams: When the page is refreshed, the teams are reshuffled and the comparison starts again.

## Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For managing state and logic.
External API: For fetching dynamic Pokémon data.
